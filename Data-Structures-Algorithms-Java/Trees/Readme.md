A tree is a popular data structure that is non-linear in nature. Unlike other data structures like array, stack, queue, and linked list which are linear in nature, a tree represents a hierarchical structure. The ordering information of a tree is not important. A tree contains nodes and 2 pointers. These two pointers are the left child and the right child of the parent node. Let us understand the terms of tree in detail.

Root: The root of a tree is the topmost node of the tree that has no parent node. There is only one root node in every tree.

Edge: Edge acts as a link between the parent node and the child node.

Leaf: A node that has no child is known as the leaf node. It is the last node of the tree. There can be multiple leaf nodes in a tree.

Depth: The depth of the node is the distance from the root node to that particular node.

Height: The height of the node is the distance from that node to the deepest node of the tree.

Height of tree: The Height of the tree is the maximum height of any node. A tree contains nodes and 2 pointers. These two pointers are the left child and the right child of the parent node. Let us understand the terms of tree in detail.
